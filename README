# x48

Original README is [here](doc/README).

If all goes well, simply running **[./fedora.sh](fedora.sh)** should build and install the x48 rpm, link to a ROM in **/usr/share/x48**,
and initialize the app.  The app binary is wrapped by a shell script that automatically does `x48 -initialize` when necessary.  The
initialize phase may show a seemingly non-functional calculator.  If that happens then exit the app and start it again.

The default rom is **gxrom-r**; another good choice is **sxrom-j**.  The ROM can be changed by doing

    rm -rf ~/.hp48
    mkdir ~/.hp48
    cd ~/.hp48
    ln -svf /usr/share/x48/other-rom ./rom

linking to the ROM of your choice.
